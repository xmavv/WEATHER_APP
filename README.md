## Hi! ðŸ˜›

Thanks for checking out my first project
I made this project because of curiosity, if I am able to do such one
Recently I saw some design of weather cards, and I wanted to do such design on my own, then I thought it also would be nice to code something like this, and there it is!

## Problems and bugs

There might be a lot of problems, especially in my code, I am aware of that, I have just started learning, and so mistakes were made...

I think there would be some problems with funcions in js, and many many divs in html (probably styling in css too)

## Demo video

There will be a video, when I learn how to insert such one
